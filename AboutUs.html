<h2>About us</h2>

<p>
The CookPal team is made up of five members with diverse skill sets and each are dedicated to ensuring that CookPal succeeds in its goal to help 
people cook. We aim on helping everyone from the professional chef to people who just started cooking.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea of this app came from the epidemic we find ourselves in and the notion that now, 
more people are cooking at home. We know that cooking is a skill that requires a lot of time and a lot 
of food so we wanted to help people make the process of cooking easier and while the app can’t cook the food for you,
it can aid in the preparation and other things too. When thinking of this idea, we thought to ourselves
“what annoys us the most when cooking” and using what we listed and what we could feasibly do in an app we developed the features CookPal would have. 
<br/>
<br/>
Cooking is difficult and having to manage everything is a pain so our goal is to assist in that management and make the cooking process easier through the CookPal app!
